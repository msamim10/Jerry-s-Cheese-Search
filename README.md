# Jerry-s-Cheese-Search
In this C programming project, you will help Jerry the mouse find food in a maze by implementing iterative and recursive search functions. You will read the maze and directions files as command line arguments, 
and use file reading, file writing, and iterating through two-dimensional arrays to solve the problem while adhering to specific restrictions and requirements.
